This inspired our team to explore people’s alcohol consumption preferences. After browsing through a number of official government statistics websites, we were very fortunate to find historical records of alcohol consumption in Iowa for 2019 on the Iowa government website. We wonder if we can discover some of the alcohol consumption preferences of Iowa residents, and if store owners and suppliers might be able to rationalize the wholesale and inventory of alcohol if they are aware of people’s preferences. In this 2019 Iowa Liquor Sales dataset, there are very few missing values and as many as 24 attributes, which include Date of consumption, Store Name, Category Name, Vendor name and more, detailing every single alcohol consumption. In addition, this dataset is rich in Catigorical Data as well as Numerical Data, and we can use as many kinds of charts as possible to explore the data in the subsequent analysis. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic We will analyze the dataset from three main perspectives. First, we will select some purchase volume indicators to show people’s drinking preferences. Then, we will analyze whether preferences differ between regions in Iowa from a geographic perspective. Finally, we will analyze whether people’s alcohol consumption follows the seasons from a temporal perspective. People’s drinking preferences We will use attributes such as Category Name, Sale (Dollars), etc. to represent people’s consumption preferences. For example, we will find out which liquors are the most popular in Iowa and which are the least popular. Which type of alcohol had the highest turnover in 2019. Whether people buy alcohol in large or small quantities. Regional perspective In addition, detailed geographic information is given in the dataset, which includes the store address, the county and the city where it is located. We want to study the differences in people’s alcohol consumption in different regions. For example, at which administrative level is there an obvious difference in alcohol consumption, the City level or the County level or the Zipcode level? Timing perspective Finally, our dataset also records the time of each alcoholic beverage purchase, with data accurate to the day. We will use the Date to explore whether Iowa residents’ consumption of alcohol is influenced by season. Whether there are significant cyclical variations in people’s consumption of alcohol, etc. 2.2 Data availability In this 2019 Iowa Liquor Sales dataset, there are very few missing values. There are as many as 24 attributes, which include Date of consumption, Store Name, Category Name, Vendor name and more, detailing every single alcohol consumption. In addition, this dataset is rich in Catigorical Data as well as Numerical Data, and we can use as many kinds of charts as possible to explore the data in the subsequent analysis. The dataset was collected from grocery stores, liquor stores, convenience stores and so on which has Class E liquor license. If we encounter some questions, we can simply submit contact request form in Iowa government website. How to use the data? We can export it as csv file and import to Rstudio. The dataset consists of 2.38 million points with 24 columns. In this particular project, we will discard the identification information such as “Invoice Number”, “Store Adress”, “Item Number”, etc. In the next modules, Catigorical Data and Numerical Data, we analyze each of the attributes contained in the database, their size, origin and some characteristics. 2.2.1 Catigorical Data Date: from 01/02/2019 to 12/31/2019.

Bottle Volume (Volume of each liquor bottle ordered in milliliters) column Bottle Volume (ml) has a mean of 876.64, a standard deviation of 521.43, a min of 20.0, a median of 750.0, and a max of 6000.0 State Bottle Cost (The amount that the Alcoholic Beverages Division paid for each bottle of liquor ordered) column State Bottle Cost has a mean of 10.34, a standard deviation of 8.57, a min of 0.89, a median of 8.25, and a max of 1749.12 Bottles Sold (The number of bottles of liquor ordered by the store) column Bottles Sold has a mean of 11.28, a standard deviation of 31.31, a min of 1.0, a median of 6.0, and a max of 6750.0 State Bottle Retail (The amount the store paid for each bottle of liquor ordered) column State Bottle Retail has a mean of 15.52, a standard deviation of 12.86, a min of 1.34, a median of 12.38, and a max of 2623.68 Sale (Total cost of liquor order (number of bottles multiplied by the state bottle retail) column Sale (Dollars) has a mean of 146.71, a standard deviation of 487.18, a min of 1.34, a median of 75.36, and a max of 78435.0 Volume Sold (Total volume of liquor ordered in liters) column Volume Sold (Liters) has a mean of 9.37, a standard deviation of 38.24, a min of 0.02, a median of 4.8, and a max of 11812.5 Volume Sold: column Volume Sold (Gallons) has a mean of 2.47, a standard deviation of 10.1, a min of 0.0, a median of 1.26, and a max of 3120.53. This column should be a simple linear transformation of the the above column. (Data description is from 2019 Iowa Liquor Sales dataset which recording the information on liquor sales in Iowa.)

How is it collected? If there were a choice of options, explain how you chose. (It’s ok if there some repetition with the previous chapter. Chapter 2 will reflect your thinking at the time of the proposal and Chapter 3 will represent the state of the project when it is complete.) Provide some basic information about the data: types of variables, number of records, etc. Describe any issues / problems with the data, either known or that you discover.) (suggested: approximately 1 page) In this 2019 Iowa Liquor Sales dataset,](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/2019-Iowa-Liquor-Sales/38x4-vs5h),) there are very few missing values. There are as many as 24 attributes, which include Date of consumption, Store Name, Category Name, Vendor name and more, detailing every single alcohol consumption.

If your code does not lend itself to being including in the .Rmd  file, provide a link to the folder or file(s) that contain(s) that code. (If your data did not require any cleaning or transformation before beginning EDA simply state that.)) (suggested: approximately 1/2 page) Since the source data file size is too large, the source file is over 500MB, which exceeds the limit of GitHub upload, we first used Python to randomly sample one-tenth of the data as the research data for this project. Second, we eliminated some redundant column data according to the need of the study. To better present the pattern of missing values on the graph, we rename the column of the data. 3.3 Missing value analysis Describe any patterns you discover in missing values. If no values are missing, graphs should still be included showing that. (suggested: 2 graphs plus commentary) To explore the presence of missing values, we first coun how many missing values exist for each attribute. ## City Zip Code County Number County Category ## 188 188 188 188 115 ## Category Name Bottles Sold State Bottle Cost State Bottle Retail Volume Sold (Gallons) ## 115 7 1 1 1 ## Date Store Number Store Name Vendor Number Vendor Name ## 0 0 0 0 0 ## Item Number Item Description Pack Bottle Volume (ml) Sale (Dollars) ## 0 0 0 0 0 We directly delete the data with missing values.
