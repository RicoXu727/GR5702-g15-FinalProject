# Data

## Sources

Describe the data sources: who is responsible for collecting the data? How is it collected? If there were a choice of options, explain how you chose. (It's ok if there some repetition with the previous chapter. Chapter 2 will reflect your thinking at the time of the proposal and Chapter 3 will represent the state of the project when it is complete.)

Provide some basic information about the data: types of variables, number of records, etc.

Describe any issues / problems with the data, either known or that you discover.

(suggested: approximately 1 page)

## Cleaning / transformation

Describe the process of getting the data into a form in which you could work with it in R if relevant. If your code does not lend itself to being including in the `.Rmd` Â file, provide a link to the folder or file(s) that contain(s) that code. (If your data did not require any cleaning or transformation before beginning EDA simply state that.)

(suggested: approximately 1/2 page)

## Missing value analysis

Describe any patterns you discover in missing values. If no values are missing, graphs should still be included showing that.

(suggested: 2 graphs plus commentary)
